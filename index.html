    <h1>Georgeimus</h1>
    <p>The writer says that God hates seven things: eyes that are haughty, a tongue that lies, hands that shed the blood of innocent people, hearts which plot evil, feet that run to do evil things, people who lie as witnesses, and one who causes strife in his or her family. Ishmael means God hears. </p>
